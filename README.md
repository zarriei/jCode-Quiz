# jCode-Quiz

## Task

This weeks assignment consisted of creating a simple quiz with certain criteria.  We had to create two html files as well as two js files.  
We were tasked with creating a series of questions that would render once a start button was clicked.  Also, we were to include a timer and that timer would deduct time even more if the player got the question wrong.  Also, we were to include the answer or let the player know if they got the question write or wrong.

At the end of the quiz we were told to display the final score and have a field for the player to enter intials in order to be able to save their highscore.
Lastly, we were to include on the initial landing page a link to a view highscores page.

## Takeawy

I got a bit frustrated doing this assignment as it was quite difficult coming up with a plan for my javascript.  I was able to map out most of the variables I needed and a few of the functions but had trouble with coming up with the rest.  Also, I am still learning all the syntax but I used console log to debug my code which helped me to almost get everything done.  I was unable to resolve my questions stacking error as it as not popping up in my console.log.

Furthermore, I had fun and wanted to pull my hair out at the same time.  My key takeaway from this is putting more studying done this weekend pertaining to API and DOM manipulation.
Also, I need to just do class activites more and more coding will help resolve my syntax issues.
